➔ **Quick Setup & Hardening Windows tool.**<br/>
In my current role as a **systems and network administrator** and as a **cybersecurity student** building my own homelab, I regularly find myself **manually configuring and reinstalling Windows** setups _from scratch_.<br/><br/>
While many similar tools exist, none to date has automated every step as cleanly and comprehensively as neoWinzard (neo for “new,” Win for “Windows,” & Winzard).
